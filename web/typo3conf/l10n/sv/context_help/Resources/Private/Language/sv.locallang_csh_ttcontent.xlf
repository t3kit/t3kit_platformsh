				<source>The main text of the Content Element is entered here and can be formatted with HTML or a Rich Text Editor.
The field is reused in other Content Element types so changing the type will cause any text to be reused in that new Content Element type.

When you're using this field with the "Text" and "Text &amp; Images" types, the content is normal body text. Each linebreak signifies a new paragraph, you can use the special TYPO3 tag, &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt;, for making links. You can use many HTML tags but there are limitations depending on your website configuration.
A Rich Text Editor is commonly used to add a visual editing interface for 'Text' and 'Text &amp; Images' Content Elements.

&lt;b&gt;Bullet Lists:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Bullet List" each line in this field is a bullet item.

&lt;b&gt;Tables:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Table" each line represents a table row. Within each line, columns are divided by a vertical bar ('|'). A table row with 3 columns could look like "This is column 1 | Column 2 here | Third column!". The table wizard can also be used for creating tables and is much easier than hand coding them.

&lt;b&gt;Parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
Types like "Form" and "Multimedia" use this field for parameters than can be passed to the Content Element. The "HTML" type expects raw HTML which is simply displayed on the website without any processing.

&lt;b&gt;Making a mail form:&lt;/b&gt;
When you have selected the "Form" Content Element you can enter form field and other options. This is a brief example:

Your name: | *name=input,40 | [Enter name!]
Your email: | *email=input,40
Your address: | address=textarea,40,10
Your haircolor: |hair=radio|Blue=blue, Red=red

|formtype_mail = submit | Send Form
|subject=hidden| Enter a subject here!
|html_enabled=hidden | 1

The first two lines makes input fields for name and email. Both are marked as "required" and are designated by the *, and the name field has a default value of "[Enter name!]".
The third line is a text box and the fourth makes radio buttons to select a hair color.
After the input fields, there are three important lines in the end. The first makes a submit button with the label "Send Form", the second line is the subject of the email the receiver gets, and the third line formats the email using HTML.
Like the table wizard, it is easier to use the form wizard rather than hand coding the forms.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; For a form to work you must add an email address for the Recipient Email in its field.</source>
			<target state="translated">Den viktigaste texten i innehållselementet anges här och kan formateras med HTML eller textredigeraren.
Fältet återanvänds i andra typer av innehållselement, så förändring av elementtyp gör att texten kan återanvändas i det nya innehållselementet.

När du använder det här fältet i "Text" och "Text &amp; bild", är innehållet vanlig brödtext. Varje radbrytning innebär ett nytt stycke och du kan använda speciella TYPO3 taggar, &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt;, för att göra länkar. Du kan använda många HTML-taggar, men det finns begränsningar beroende på din webbplats konfiguration.
En textredigerare används vanligen för att lägga till ett visuellt redigeringsgränssnitt för "Text" och "Text &amp; Bild".

&lt;b&gt;Punktlistor:&lt;/b&gt;
Om typen är "Punktlista" är varje rad i detta fält en punkt.

&lt;b&gt;Tabeller:&lt;/b&gt;
Om typen är "Tabell" representerar varje rad en tabellrad. Inom varje rad indelas kolumner med ett lodrätt streck ('|'). En tabellrad med 3 kolumner kan se ut "Detta är kolumn 1 | Kolumn 2 här | Tredje kolumnen!". Tabellenguiden kan också användas för att skapa tabeller och är mycket enklare än att manuellt koda dem.

&lt;b&gt;Parametrar:&lt;/b&gt;
Innehållstyper som "Formulär" och "Multimedia" använder detta fält för parametrar som kan skickas till innehållselement. "Ren HTML"-elementet förväntar sig rå HTML-kod, som visas på hemsidan utan behandling.

&lt;b&gt;Att skapa ett e-postformulär:&lt;/b&gt;
När du har valt "Formulär"-element kan du ange formulärfält och andra alternativ. Detta är ett kort exempel:

Ditt namn: | *namn=input,40 | [Skriv ditt namn!]
Din E-post: | *epost=input,40
Din adress: | adress=textarea,40,10
Din hårfärg: | harfarg=radio | Blå=blue, Röd=red

|formtype_mail = submit | Skicka
|subject=hidden| Skriv ämnet här!
|html_enabled=hidden | 1

De två första raderna skapar inmatningsfält för namn och e-post. Båda är markerade som "obligatoriska" och betecknas med *, och namnfältet har ett standardvärde "[Skriv ditt namn!]".
Den tredje raden är en textruta och den fjärde skapar radioknapparna för att välja en hårfärg.
Efter inmatningsfälten, finns det tre viktiga rader. Den första skapar en skicka knapp med etiketten "Skicka", är den andra raden är ämnesraden för det e-post som mottagaren får, och den tredje raden formaterar e-post med HTML.
Liksom med tabellenguiden, är det lättare att använda formulärguiden, snarare än att koda formuläret manuellt.

&lt;b&gt;OBS:&lt;/b&gt; För att ett formulär ska fungera måste du lägga till en e-postadress för att Mottagarens e-postadress i avsett fält.</target></trans-unit>

				<source>The 'Type' of content you select determines which options are available in the editing form so be sure to save the record before making other changes.

This is a description of the various types:

&lt;strong&gt;Header&lt;/strong&gt;
This type allows you to insert a standard Content Element header and nothing more.
Almost all the other types described below also include the Header and its options. The Header type provides a way to insert a header without any other content.

&lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt;
The Text type allows you to insert regular page content. It is generally used for text only content.

&lt;strong&gt;Text &amp; Images&lt;/strong&gt;
This is the same as the Text type (regular page content) but with the option of attaching images.

&lt;strong&gt;Image&lt;/strong&gt;
The Image type allows you to insert image only page content.

&lt;strong&gt;Bullet List&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create a bullet list. Each line in the text field will appear as a single bullet.

&lt;strong&gt;Table&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; tables. Each line represents a row in the table and vertical bars ('|') separate each column. A popup wizard is also available.

&lt;strong&gt;File Links&lt;/strong&gt;
Allows you to present a list of files for download. Thumbnails can be attached to the list and you can also display the file size.

&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create mail forms using a special syntax or a popup wizard.

&lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt;
This inserts a search box and also shows the search results when a search is performed on the page.

&lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt;
Displays a login box for website users. This is only useful if you have already created website users and usergroups.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu/Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Offers a selection of menus and a sitemap you can insert on a page.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert records&lt;/strong&gt;
This acts as placeholder for other records. With this Content Element, you can resuse multiple content elements from other pages.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert plugin&lt;/strong&gt;
This will allows you to insert news, forums, guestbooks, lists of addresses, and other functionality. Plugins are typically provided by TYPO3 extensions. The available fields and required configuration depend on the extension.

&lt;strong&gt;Divider&lt;/strong&gt;
This inserts a simple horizontal rule on a page.

&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;
This is plain HTML content. Anything added in the HTML Code of this Content Element will be displayed directly on the page without any preprocessing.</source>
			<target state="translated">Den "typ" av innehåll som du väljer, avgör vilka alternativ som finns tillgängliga i redigeringsformuläret, så se till att spara posten innan du gör andra förändringar.

Detta är en beskrivning av de olika typerna:

&lt;strong&gt;Rubrik&lt;/strong&gt;
Denna typ gör att du kan infoga ett standard innehållselement med endast en rubrik.
i nästan alla typer av element, som beskrivs nedan, ingår även Rubrik och dess alternativ. Typen Rubrik är ett sätt att sätta en rubrik utan annat innehåll.

&lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt;
Med typen Text kan du infoga vanligt sidinnehåll. Det används allmänt för endast textinnehåll.

&lt;strong&gt;Text &amp; Bild&lt;/strong&gt;
Detta är samma som typ Text (vanligt sidinnehåll) men med möjlighet att bifoga bilder.

&lt;strong&gt;Bild&lt;/strong&gt;
Med typen Bild kan du infoga endast bildinnehåll.

&lt;strong&gt;Punktlista&lt;/strong&gt;
Låter dig skapa en punktlista. Varje rad i textfältet visas som en punkt.

&lt;strong&gt;Tabell&lt;/strong&gt;
Låter dig skapa &lt;em&gt;enkla&lt;/em&gt; tabeller. Varje linje representerar en rad i tabellen och vertikala stänger ('|') separerar varje kolumn. En formulärguide finns också tillgänglig.

&lt;strong&gt;Fillänkar&lt;/strong&gt;
Gör det möjligt att presentera en lista med filer för nedladdning. Miniatyrer kan bifogas i listan och du kan även visa filstorleken.

&lt;strong&gt;Formulär&lt;/strong&gt;
Låter dig skapa e-postformulär med hjälp av en speciell syntax eller en formulärguide.

&lt;strong&gt;Sökformulär&lt;/strong&gt;
Denna infogar en sökruta och visar även sökresultaten när en sökning utförs på sidan.

&lt;strong&gt;Inloggningsformulär&lt;/strong&gt;
Visar en inloggningsruta för webbplatsens användare. Detta är endast användbart om du redan har skapat webbplatsanvändare och användargrupper.

&lt;strong&gt;Meny/Webbplatskarta&lt;/strong&gt;
Erbjuder ett urval av menyer och en webbplatskarta som du kan placera på en sida.

&lt;strong&gt;Infoga referens&lt;/strong&gt;
Detta fungerar som platshållare för andra innehållselement. Med detta innehållselement, kan du återanvända innehållselement från andra sidor.

&lt;strong&gt;Infoga plugin&lt;/strong&gt;
Detta gör att du kan infoga nyheter, forum, gästböcker, adresslistor och andra funktioner. Plugins tillhandahålls vanligtvis av TYPO3 moduler. De tillgängliga fält och konfiguration varierar beroende på pluginet.

&lt;strong&gt;Avskiljare&lt;/strong&gt;
Infogar en enkel horisontell linje på en sida.

&lt;strong&gt;Ren HTML&lt;/strong&gt;
Detta är vanligt HTML-innehåll. Allt som infogas i HTML-kod för detta innehållselement, kommer att visas direkt på sidan utan någon behandling.</target></trans-unit>

Depending on the configuration of TYPO3, you can attach images in many formats without worrying about size and compression. TYPO3's graphics processing handles these details for you.

When you use the "Text &amp; Images" type, it's important to select a proper position for images. For this purpose, use the Position and Aligment selector. See link to "Page Content / Position" below.
You can also display images in multiple columns and even enable an option that opens full size images when thumbnails are clicked.</source>

				<source>The positions above and below the body text are pretty straight forward.
The options for "In text" mean that images are displayed with text wrapped around them. When you select this option the template will probably force the images into smaller dimensions to accommodate the width of the template and the width of the text. The bodytext will float &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the image block when it reaches the end of the image block. In other words, the body text &lt;em&gt;wraps around&lt;/em&gt; the image block. If you select "In text" below the "No wrap" divider, the body text will not float under the image block, but simply continue in its column.
Apart from the visual difference there is a technical aspect as well. If you choose to allow the content to wrap the image block you will experience a strange phenomenon when you do not have enough bodytext to make it float around the image: subsequent content elements on the page will appear to be layered on top of the image block. However it's easily solved by changing the "In text" position to the equal value but below the "No wrap" divider.</source>
			<target state="needs-translation">Placeringen över och under brödtext är ganska självklar.
Alternativen för "I texten" innebär att bilderna visas med text lindad runt dem. När du väljer det här alternativet kommer mallen förmodligen tvinga bilderna till mindre dimensioner för att passa bredden på mallen och bredden på texten. Brödtexten flyter &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; bildblocket när den når slutet på bildblocket. Med andra ord, brödtexten &lt;em&gt;bäddar in&lt;/em&gt; bildblocket. Om du väljer "I texten" under avdelaren "Ingen inbäddning", kommer brödtexten inte att flyta ut under bildblocket, utan helt enkelt fortsätta i sin kolumn.
Förutom den visuella skillnaden finns en teknisk aspekt. Om du väljer att låta innehållet bädda in bildblocket, kommer du att uppleva ett märkligt fenomen när du inte har tillräckligt med brödtext för att kunna flyta runt bilden: efterföljande innehållselement på sidan ser ut att vara skiktad ovanpå bildblocket . Det är dock enkelt lösas genom att ändra placeringen "I texten" till lika värde men under avdelaren "Ingen inbäddning" istället.</target></trans-unit>

				<source>This option does not work by default for all Content Elements but your website may display Content Elements differently depending on the layout.

The File Links Content Element does make use of the Layout field by default:
"Normal" will provide a list of file links with no thumbnail.
"Layout 1" adds a file icon to the left of the link
"Layout 2" adds a thumbnail for image files and an icon for other files. A black border is wrapped around the icon.
"Layout 3" is similar to Layout 2, but without the black border.</source>
			<target state="translated">Det här alternativet fungerar inte som standard för alla innehållselement, men din webbplats kan visa innehållselement olika beroende på layouten.

Fillänkelementet utnyttjar layoutfältet som standard:
"Normal" kommer att ge en lista på fillänkar utan miniatyrbild.
"Layout 1" lägger till en filikon till vänster om länken
"Layout 2" lägger till en miniatyrbild för bildfiler och en ikon för andra filer. En svart ram placeras runt ikonen.
"Layout 3" liknar Layout 2, men utan den svarta ramen.</target></trans-unit>

				<source>This is a short description of each type:

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of selected pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This will create a menu with links to the pages in the Selected Pages list.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This will create in a menu with links to the subpages of the pages in the Selected Pages list. If you do not specify any pages, the subpages to the current page will be used.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages (with abstract)&lt;/strong&gt;
Like the previous option, but also displays the content of the Abstract field (or the Description field) for each page in the menu. The Abstract field is given priority over the Description field if both are complete.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages + sections&lt;/strong&gt;
Like the previous option, but includes links to all Content Elements on the page that are marked to Show In Section Menus.

&lt;strong&gt;Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Generates a classic tree sitemap. Notice that the sitemap will begin from the current page unless you select another page instead.

&lt;strong&gt;Section index (page content marked for section menus)&lt;/strong&gt;
This makes a menu of Content Elements on the selected pages for all Content Elements marked to Show In Section Menu. This is a great way to make an index at the top of the page.
If you don't want certain Content Elements to appear in the list, just uncheck the Show in Section Menus checkbox for those elements.

&lt;strong&gt;Recently updated pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This displays the 10 most recently updated pages.
&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; If you update a page and the updated page is not included in this list, clearing the Page Cache will resolve the issue.

&lt;strong&gt;Related pages (based on keywords)&lt;/strong&gt;
Displays other related pages based on the keywords of the selected pages matched against the keywords of other pages.</source>

				<source>This field is used by many of the Content Element types to create a relation to either a single target page or multiple target pages. If no target page is specified, the current page will generally be used.

Using the "Search" Content Element, the target page is where search results will appear. You must make sure that this page has a similar "Search" Content Element to display the results.

The "Login" Content Element (not to be confused with the Login plugin available when the felogin extension is installed) also uses this field to redirect the login to a certain page. That page does not need to contain a "Login" Content Element in order to perform the authentication since any TYPO3 page can handle a login request.
If you specify a second page in this list, the ID will be passed to the login system as the page inside TYPO3 where website users are found. You should use this only if your template is not already configured to pass this value on.
In order for the login procedure to work you must make sure that you have created website users and website usergroups, have specified where these website users can be found (typically a SysFolder), a page ID in the page list, and ensured that cookies are enabled for the site.

The "Menu/Sitemap" Content Elements also use this field. In this case the page will determine the starting point for the menu or the actual pages shown in the menu. This behavior depends on the menu type you have selected.

Finally the "Form" element uses this field as the target page to which the form is submitted. A common use is the "Thank you" page after the form is completed.</source>
